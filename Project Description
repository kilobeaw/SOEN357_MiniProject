YOUR TASK
Develop a visual prototype of a super app aimed at providing travelers’ needs. You can choose
to either have an online desktop version OR mobile app version. To design the prototype, you
should use an appropriate UX/UI design process (as discussed in class). As design is a creative
process each student’s work will differ and the processes will also differ slightly. Below are some
guidelines to help you get started.

Understand the problem: 
Remember the first step is to truly understand the problem. UX/UI
design is the process of solving a problem for a user, helping the user achieve their goals with
ease and more than that making them feel great while doing so. Make sure you clearly understand
the problem that TripFellow Inc. is asking you to solve.

Research and analysis: 
Look at what already exists, other super apps, why do they work or not
work? Use interviews and questionnaires to understand your users, build user personas, user
journeys, perform tasks analysis, flow charts, IA structure, empathy maps, and/or storyboards,
etc. You do not need to have all of these, use a design process with the steps that you feel are
most appropriate and determine the UX/UI deliverables you should present to TripFellow Inc.
You should determine the most important user goals for a Travel Companion SuperApp.

User Research: 
Ethical principles and guidelines form an indivisible part of conducting research.
Research ethics are moral principles that guide researchers to conduct and report research
without deception or intention to harm the participants of the study or members of the society as
a whole, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Practicing ethical guidelines while conducting and
reporting research is essential to establish the validity of your research. It is important that when
you are working with potential users, asking them questions or testing your designs that you get
informed consent using the provided ethics consent form. Note that informed consent is a process
of communication whereby the study participant is enabled to make an informed and voluntary
decision about accepting or not accepting to partake in your study. They are informed about the
purpose of the study, details about the research, how the research results will be used and stored,
about any possible negative side effects, etc. Please use the provided consent form when asking
participants to partake in your research.

Create prototypes:
Use sketches, wireframes, mock-ups, style guides. Consider, colour,
animation, fonts, logo, etc. Be creative and have fun!

NB: 
the goal is not to create a functioning prototype, rather your goal is to go through the design
process and to develop and create a visual prototype considering UX/UI principles.
